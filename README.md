These are the first files that I created, the first one is a file of Eclipse, I spend two weeks tryng to use Eclipse but in the end did not work, so I came back to IntelliJ
The GitHub was created three weeks ago, however I upload the files recently because I was creating and delating all my examples because they were not working.
The Smart Hotel Ricardo is the final result with the three servers.
The example says smartoffice because I confussed my student number, then I modify it to smarthotel, but just in case of why the name of the example.
